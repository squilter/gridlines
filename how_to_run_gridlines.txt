Once the simulation starts, we need to forward the mavlink packets to itself
output add 0.0.0.0:14550

Now we can start the script in a new terminal
Clone https://github.com/mit-uav/comm
cd comm/
python gridlines.py

We connect the the uav on the local machine (0.0.0.0), on the port 14550
We arm the quadcopter and move into move guided, then takeoff to 5 meters.
Then we can start accepting commands
